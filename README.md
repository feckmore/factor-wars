#Factor Wars

###How to Play
Each of two players take turns.  On each turn, you select one of the previously unselected numbers on the board.  You get points corresponding to the value of the number selected.  However, your opponent gets points corresponding to the value of all of the factors of the selected number, if the points for those factors have not already been assigned to either player on a previous turn.

###Background
My son, now in fourth grade, introduced me to this game.  While going through an introductory tutorial on AngularJS, I realized it would be fairly simple to implement a functional version of this game.  So, this is my attempt at learning some AngularJS, while making something fun for my son.
