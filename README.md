###How to Play
My son, now in fourth grade, introduced me to this game.  Each of two players take turns.  On each turn, you select one of the previously unselected numbers on the board.  You get points corresponding to the value of the number selected.  However, your opponent gets points corresponding to the value of all of the factors of the selected number, if the points for those factors have not already been assigned to either player on a previous turn.
